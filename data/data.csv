266,["Enforcement and litigation"],["Money laundering"],UK FCA annual report shows increase in total fines against individuals and insight on upcoming monitoring activity,"The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed around GBP 227.3 million in fines during the last fiscal year, more than three times that of the previous year, according to the annual report 2018/19 published on 9 July. The report finds that the FCA imposed GBP 80.2 million in fines against eight individuals during the fiscal year ending 31 March 2019, compared with GBP 900,000 in fines against 10 individuals during the previous year. The FCA also published a related annual report on anti-money laundering (AML), which explains that it has over 60 ongoing AML investigations and provides a case study on the fines issued against Standard Chartered Bank for AML breaches. The report also states that some of the FCA’s current AML investigations are now dual track, which may result in either criminal or civil proceedings. According to the FCA these dual track investigations are helping the FCA to “fully understand what happened, what action to take and which tools to use.”"
267,["Consultations"],["Money laundering"],UK government publishes AML/CTF supervision report,"The UK Treasury published its anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing (AML/CTF) supervision report for 2017-2018 on 8 July, which confirms the UK’s intention to transpose the Fifth Money Laundering Directive into UK law by January 2020. The report highlights that there are inconsistencies in the quality of supervision among the UK’s AML/CTF supervisors. While the statutory supervisors have a strong understanding of the risks, the UK needs to sustain its efforts in addressing the significant deficiencies in supervision of its other professional bodies. According to the report there are significant weaknesses in the risk-based approach to supervision among all supervisors, with the exception of the Gambling Commission. Efforts have been made to address weaknesses in supervision and sanctions of the accountancy and legal sectors, although these failings continue to have an impact on the preventive measures applied and the quality of financial intelligence gathered. The report’s recommendations include that the Financial Conduct Authority should follow the practice of other statutory supervisors by considering the wider use of criminal background checks as part of its processes to ensure criminals and their associates are prevented from owning or controlling financial institutions; and that plans to extend AML/ CTF requirements and related supervision to virtual currency exchange providers should continue to progress."

In 2018/19, 17 of 32 defendants were convicted, which is a conviction rate of 53 percent by defendant and 86 percent by case. In reference to the conclusion of the UK’s first deferred prosecution agreement with Standard Bank plc, Osofsky states that the SFO aims to build on this with greater private sector cooperation and will seek to provide transparency regarding what a company should expect if it decides to self-report.The SFO also secured its first Account Forfeiture Order this year, which targeted GBP 1.5 million in funds from a mortgage fraud scheme. “There will be more to follow,” said Osofsky. 

Meanwhile, the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI) published the findings of its leadership review of the SFO on 19 July, following a request from the SFO to provide an independent assessment of staff engagement within the organisation. 

The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) published its annual report and accounts 2018-19 on 22 July, which states that in the last year GBP 29.5 million in criminal assets have been frozen using the new powers provided under the Criminal Finances Act.The annual report provides detailed analysis of the NCA’s progress against its priorities, which includes an overview of the work being UK’s SFO and NCA publish their annual reports 2018/19 carried out by the National Economic Crime Centre, which began operating in October 2018. The annual report highlights cybercrime as a threat that continues to grow in scale and complexity, and that over the past year an increasing blurring of boundaries between activities perpetrated by criminals and those by nation state actors has been identified. The NCA also draws attention to its work to lead planning for the UK’s withdrawal from EU systems, tools and processes due to Brexit; and the work of the National Strategic Tasking and Coordination Group, which aims to disrupt high-impact criminals and organised crime groups that exploit the vulnerable and undermine financial system integrity."
269,["Consultations"],"[""Money laundering"", ""Fraud""]",UK’s new Economic Crime Plan sets out priority areas,"The UK Treasury and the Home Office published the new Economic Crime Plan (ECP) on 12 July, which sets out seven priority areas, including assessing threats of fraud, money laundering and other such economic crime facing the country and improving the transparency of ownership. The ECP sets seven strategic priorities to better tackle economic crime, which includes: • Reforming the SARs regime, with Barclays, HSBC UK, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS and Santander UK investing GBP 6.5 million in 2019/20; • Establishing a new cryptoassets regime with the FCA, going beyond international standards to create “one of the most comprehensive global responses to the use of cryptoassets in illicit activity”; • Promoting innovation in the private sector and encouraging businesses to take advantage of new technologies to combat crime and reduce compliance costs; and • Implementing the new Asset Recovery Action Plan, which sets out measures to enhance efforts to claw back the proceeds of crime. A policy paper was also published. Agreed actions set out in the ECP include: • By July 2020, HM Treasury and the National Economic Crime Centre will expand and enhance public-private information sharing through the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT); • By July 2020, HM Treasury, the Home Office and the UK’s Financial Intelligence Unit will consider tactical targeting orders; • By December 2020, the first tranche of the SARs IT transformation will be delivered and the target operating model for the future of the SARs regime will be designed; and • By July 2020, HM Treasury will clarify whether powers are necessary to enable private sector supervisors to take enforcement action over deficiencies in sanctions implementation. The ECP states that the FCA will become the supervisor for certain types of cryptoasset activities and highlighted the need for an AML regime for some activities. The FCA issued a statement explaining that it is developing its approach and will publish details this year. The minutes from the Economic Crime Strategic Board’s meeting, which commissioned the ECP, have also been made public. Highlights from the meeting include: • A discussion on current and emerging risks: trade-based money laundering and laundering through capital markets were identified as an evolving threat. Cryptocurrencies’ use in money laundering was said to be small but growing. Professionals (lawyers, accountants and trust and company service providers (TCSPs)) continue to help facilitate laundering, with one TCSP involved in a significant sanctions evasion case; and • Actors in Russia and China were seen to be the biggest offshore money laundering threat. Russia, Pakistan and Nigeria were key source countries for PEPs involved in corruption. The board also discussed the tension in doing business with jurisdictions viewed as ‘safe’ but that let laundered funds into the international system."

The legal proceedings initiated will see Italy referred to the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) for its failure to address an illegal system of exemptions for fuel used to power chartered yachts in EU waters and the sending of reasoned opinions to Italy and Cyprus for not levying the correct amount of VAT on the leasing of yachts."
